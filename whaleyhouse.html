            <blockquote>"I've been here a couple times, I've had some experiences. in one of the rooms, I felt as if someone was trying to choke me, I could not breathe until I stepped out of the little square area. My 3 year old nephew kept trying to take me to see the "dog" that was running around. I didn't see anything but he was running all over the house and ended up in a corner trying to "pet" the dog. the first time I took my friend, something was tugging on my sweater on the side that was next to the wall so it couldn't have been someone." </blockquote>
